# crowdin-test
This is a test repository for testing out Crowdin workflows.

Structure:

* `crowdin.yaml` - Crowdin configuration.
* `locales` - Localisation related files synced with Crowdin.
* `src` - Test scripts NOT related to localisation or Crowdin in any way.

Tests include:

* GitHub integration tests - will it actually create a service branch from the feature branch or some other odd state?
